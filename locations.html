            <p>Modestraat is a creative community club, sew and art atelier, exchange shop, cafe and meeting point located in Amsterdam Noord. They organize weekly different activities as independent artists (including visual) shows and exhibitions, Talking Cafe where you can just sit and chat with anyone you want, drinking coffee with some nice pastry. </p>

            <p>De Modestraat is not only directed at vintage fashion but mostly creativity. Amsterdam-Noord has socially and nationally diverse people and their mission is to bring people together. De Mosestraat is supported by artists, volunteers, and artistic and cultural organisations. They have also a goal to keep their coffee prices as low as possible so everyone can enjoy a nice warm drink. </p>

            <p>Exchange shop is a place where you can exchange clothing you no longer wear for something new. Instead of prices, it has a point system which you can exchange for a clothing. You can also donate clothes.</p>

            <p>The clothing must still be wearable, so whole, clean, fresh, and not faded or worn out. All buttons are on, zippers work.</p>

            <p>You cannot hand in underwear, pyjamas, hats, swimwear and tights, unless it concerns baby clothes.</p>

            <p>From 1 September to 1 March they accept winter clothing, from 1 March to 1 September â€” summer clothing.</p>

            <p>The volunteers give points for the handed in clothing. This can vary from 1 point for a simple top, to 10 points for a coat. These points are on your card and you can use them to exchange shopping. You can also donate clothing.</p>
