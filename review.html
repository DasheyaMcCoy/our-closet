            <h2>My experience</h2>
        
            <p>The coffee there is great! I could feel that place is very artistic. It is also an atelier, and you can get your clothes fixed there or learn to make clothes yourself. There is a lot of clothes to choose from to look fashionable yet sustainable. They organize weekly different activities as independent artists (including visual) shows and exhibitions, Talking Cafe where you can just sit and chat with anyone you want, drinking coffee with some nice pastry. If you want some good company, exchange clothes or just to vibe, I recommend to go there!</p>
